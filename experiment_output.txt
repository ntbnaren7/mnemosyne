--- MNEMOSYNE V0.5: VISUAL SIGNAL VALIDATION ---

[EXPERIMENT 1: CONTROL] (No Human Presence)
  LoopStage.GENERATE: ['Assign employee-led content piece', 'Target existing technical audience']
  LoopStage.PUBLISH: ['Generated Image img_83748a10 with Intent: abstract style, text_led, none human presence, 0 faces', 'Created Creative crt_7fa3d029']
  LoopStage.OBSERVE: ['Awaiting human sign-off on Post post_001']
  LoopStage.INTERPRET: ['Ingested 3 comments from platform export']
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - HumanPresence: none
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - IdentityQuestions: 0
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - Comments: ['Nice generic graphic.', 'Clean design.', 'Good update.']
  LoopStage.ADAPT: ['CAUSAL LINK FOUND: No human presence -> Zero identity signals.', 'No active contradictions detected in high-signal comments.']
  LoopStage.PLAN: ['No changes required.']

[EXPERIMENT 2: VARIANT] (Explicit Human Presence)
  LoopStage.GENERATE: ['Assign employee-led content piece', 'Target existing technical audience']
  LoopStage.PUBLISH: ['Generated Image img_20a9173c with Intent: illustrative style, subject_centered, explicit human presence, 1-2 faces', 'Created Creative crt_c7962769']
  LoopStage.OBSERVE: ['Awaiting human sign-off on Post post_001']
  LoopStage.INTERPRET: ['Ingested 3 comments from platform export']
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - HumanPresence: explicit
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - IdentityQuestions: 2
DEBUG: InterpretAgent - Comments: ['Who is this engineer? They look familiar.', 'Can I contact this person directly?', 'Is this a real employee or stock photo?']
  LoopStage.ADAPT: ['CAUSAL LINK FOUND: Explicit human presence -> 2 identity signals.', 'No active contradictions detected in high-signal comments.']
  LoopStage.PLAN: ['No changes required.']

--- CONCLUSION ---
Verifying if visual attributes caused different reasoning outcomes...
