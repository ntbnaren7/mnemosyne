[SEEDING] Creating Competing Beliefs...
  > Seeding: asm_chaos_trust (Conf: 1.0)
  > Seeding: asm_order_trust (Conf: 1.0)

[ROUND 1: BASELINE]
  asm_chaos_trust: Confidence 1.0
  asm_order_trust: Confidence 1.0

[FEEDBACK INJECTION]
  > Signal: 'This visual feels too messy and hard to parse.'
    -> (No Link to asm_chaos_trust)
  > Signal: 'It is overwhelming and confusing to look at.'
    -> Targets asm_chaos_trust (Sim: 0.27 | WEAK)
  > Signal: 'I don't trust this, it looks like broken code.'
    -> (No Link to asm_chaos_trust)
  > Signal: 'Too much complexity, I want to see the high level.'
    -> Targets asm_chaos_trust (Sim: 0.38 | WEAK)
  > Signal: 'Cluttered and chaotic, not professional.'
    -> Targets asm_chaos_trust (Sim: 0.33 | WEAK)

[ADAPTATION PHASE]
  Processing 3 contradictions...

[ROUND 2: RESULT]
  asm_chaos_trust: Confidence 0.94 (Delta: -0.06)
  asm_order_trust: Confidence 1.00 (Delta: 0.00)

[EXPLANATION]
Optimization observed: The belief in 'visible complexity' failed to resonate with users.
Mnemosyne has reduced confidence in asm_chaos_trust while retaining asm_order_trust.
Future content will skew towards Order.

RESULT: SUCCESS. Mnemosyne adapted its beliefs based on semantic feedback.
