FORMAL FREEZE DECLARATION — MNEMOSYNE V2

Effective immediately, Mnemosyne V2 is declared **FROZEN**.

Mnemosyne now consists of three completed and stable layers:

- V0: Belief Core (Assumptions, Risk, Strategy)
- V1: Calibration & Safety (Semantic accuracy, confidence rails)
- V2: Temporal Intelligence (Trajectory, momentum, volatility)

========================
WHAT V2 ADDS
========================

V2 provides **temporal awareness**.

Mnemosyne can now:
- Reconstruct belief histories
- Distinguish stability from volatility
- Identify gradual decay vs sudden degradation
- Explain how beliefs reached their current state

V2 is **observational only**.

========================
NON-AUTHORITY GUARANTEE
========================

Temporal intelligence is NON-AUTHORITATIVE.

V2:
- MAY describe belief trajectories
- MAY warn humans about instability
- MAY contextualize belief confidence

V2:
- MUST NOT modify beliefs
- MUST NOT alter confidence values
- MUST NOT escalate or de-escalate risk
- MUST NOT block or force planning decisions

Any violation constitutes a breaking change.

========================
FROZEN SURFACE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================

The following are frozen and MUST NOT be modified:

- Assumption schema and lifecycle
- Semantic interpretation logic
- Confidence update mechanics
- Confidence safety rail
- Risk derivation rules
- TemporalAnalyzer read-only behavior
- Epistemic hierarchy and authority boundaries

Any change to the above requires a major version reset.

========================
SYSTEM ROLE
========================

Mnemosyne is now formally defined as:

An **organizational epistemic system** that:
- Remembers institutional beliefs
- Tracks risk and confidence
- Explains belief change over time

Mnemosyne is NOT:
- An autonomous decision-maker
- A strategy executor
- A self-directing agent

========================
FINAL PRINCIPLE
========================

Mnemosyne understands belief.
Mnemosyne understands time.
Mnemosyne does not act.

Authority remains human.

Declared Frozen.
