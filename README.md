# Mnemosyne

> **Mnemosyne is not a product.  
> It is the memory and intelligence layer that makes Simbli coherent over time.**

This repository contains the **foundational reasoning, memory, and learning systems** that power Simbli.ai.

If you are looking for UI, schedulers, or integrations — you are in the wrong place.

---

## What This Project Is

Mnemosyne is an **organizational intelligence engine** designed to:

- Maintain **narrative consistency** across time
- Preserve **strategic memory** beyond individual humans
- Learn from real-world outcomes, not vibes
- Turn content execution into a **closed learning loop**

At its core, Mnemosyne exists to answer one question:

> *“What should this company say next — and why?”*

Everything else is secondary.

---

## What This Project Is NOT

To be explicit:

- ❌ Not a social media automation tool  
- ❌ Not a prompt wrapper  
- ❌ Not an image-generation playground  
- ❌ Not a dashboard-first analytics product  

If your instinct is to “just generate better-looking posts,”  
you do not yet understand this system.

---

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Strategy precedes generation  
Nothing is generated without an explicit **intent**, **context**, and **hypothesis**.

### 2. Memory beats creativity  
Consistency compounds. Novelty without memory is noise.

### 3. Comments > likes  
Engagement metrics are weak signals.  
Questions, critiques, and conversations are truth.

### 4. Learning must persist beyond people  
If a strategist leaves and the system forgets — we failed.

### 5. Replaceability is a feature  
Models, tools, and APIs are swappable.  
The reasoning loop is not.

## The Mnemosyne Reasoning Loop

Every system in this repo exists to support a single loop:

PLAN → GENERATE → PUBLISH → OBSERVE → INTERPRET → ADAPT



If a contribution does not strengthen this loop, it does not belong here.

---

## Development Stage

This repository is currently in **V0**.

That means:
- We optimize for **clarity of thinking**, not output polish
- Human-in-the-loop is mandatory
- Zero-cost, open-source tooling is preferred
- Learning infrastructure > feature breadth

Premature optimization will be rejected.

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

These are not guidelines. They are rules.

- No identity recognition or biometric inference
- No hallucinated confidence in insights
- No auto-publishing without human review (V0)
- No strategy-free generation
- No silent metric gaming

Breaking these constraints means breaking the product.

---

## How to Contribute (Mental Model)

Before writing code, ask:

1. What part of the reasoning loop does this affect?
2. What does the agent *learn* from this?
3. What happens if this system is removed?
4. Does this create memory — or just output?

If you cannot answer these, stop.

---

## What “Good” Looks Like Here

Good contributions:
- Reduce ambiguity in decision-making
- Make learning explicit and persistent
- Improve interpretability over cleverness
- Prefer simple, inspectable systems

Bad contributions:
- Add features without reasoning hooks
- Optimize for aesthetics over understanding
- Hide logic behind magic abstractions
- Chase benchmarks instead of outcomes

---

## Repository Intent

This repo is expected to:

- Outlive early product iterations
- Survive model swaps
- Support future enterprise constraints
- Act as Simbli’s **institutional brain**

Treat it accordingly.

---

## Final Note

If Mnemosyne disappeared tomorrow,  
companies should lose **strategic continuity**, not convenience.

That is the bar.

If that feels heavy — good.  
This system is supposed to be.

**Build with intent.  
Build for memory.  
Build so the system thinks even when people don’t.**
