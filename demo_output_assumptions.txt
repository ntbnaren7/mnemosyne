--- MNEMOSYNE V0: EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS DEMO ---

[INITIAL STATE]
Assumption: A technical audience trusts individual engineers more than brand channels.
Confidence: 0.95
Risk Level: RiskLevel.LOW

[STAGING] Testing Mandatory Assumption Binding...
  Caught Expected Error: CRITICAL: Planning failed. Every PLAN step MUST reference at least one active Assumption OR explicitly record a justification for ignoring existing memory.

  [STRATEGY CHANGE EMITTED] ID: sc_b78f2779
  DECISION: Shift content focus from internal engineering narratives to technical transparency documentation.
  JUSTIFICATION: We observed significant fatigue and skepticism from our audience regarding 'corporate/employee' narratives. The signals suggest that purely internal engineer voices are being perceived as 'marketing fluff'. To maintain trust, we must pivot to more objective, documentation-style technical content.

--- FINAL ASSUMPTION STATE ---
Assumption: A technical audience trusts individual engineers more than brand channels.
Confidence: 0.95
Risk Level: RiskLevel.LOW
RESULT: Risk Level did not escalate. Logic check required.

[STAGING] Testing Planning with High Risk Assumption...
  Start of Next Loop (Plan Decisions): ['Assign employee-led content piece', 'Target existing technical audience', 'WARNING: Proceeding with High Risk Assumption asm_001. Validation required.']
RESULT: System correctly flagged High Risk Assumption in planning.
